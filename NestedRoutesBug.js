In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not working as expected.  This often stems from a misunderstanding of the `useRoutes` hook's behavior or improper nesting of route elements.  For instance, if you have a route that renders a component containing nested `<Route>` elements, these nested routes might not match if the parent route's path is not correctly defined or if there's an incorrect usage of `Outlet`.
