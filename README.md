This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6 and provides a solution. The bug involves nested routes failing to render due to path issues or incorrect `Outlet` usage. The solution shows how to properly structure nested routes and use the `Outlet` component to render child routes correctly.  The code examples use functional components and hooks.
